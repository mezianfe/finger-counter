# Finger Counter using MediaPipe and OpenCV

This project utilizes **MediaPipe** and **OpenCV** to detect hand landmarks and count the number of extended fingers in real-time using a webcam. The project leverages MediaPipe's powerful hand tracking model to detect hand landmarks and determine which fingers are extended.

## Features
- Real-time hand detection and tracking using MediaPipe.
- Accurate finger counting based on the position of hand landmarks.
- Webcam-based input with mirror effect.
- Displays the number of extended fingers on the screen.

## Requirements
- Python 3.x
- OpenCV
- MediaPipe

## Installation

1. Install required libraries:

   ```bash
   pip install opencv-python mediapipe
